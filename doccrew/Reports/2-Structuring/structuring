**2. Medical History**

* **2.1 Personal History:** Epilepsy (well-controlled with levetiracetam 500mg twice daily).
* **2.2 Family History:** Maternal side family history of migraines.


**3. Clinical Presentation**

* Current Symptoms: Witnessed episode of apnea (approximately 30 seconds), unresponsiveness during apnea, post-apnea confusion, tiredness, mild headache. Mother reported low-grade fever (38.2°C or 100.8°F) at home.
* Observations: Patient appeared stiff during the apneic episode.


**4. Physical Examination**

* Appearance: Tired but alert and oriented to person and place (disoriented to date).
* Cranial Nerves: Intact cranial nerves II-XII.

* Meningeal Signs: Absent.


**5. Additional Examinations**

* Vital Signs: Temperature 38.2°C, HR 90 bpm, RR 18 breaths/min, BP 110/70 mmHg, SpO2 98% on room air.
* Point-of-care Glucose: 90 mg/dL.
* Levetiracetam Level: Within therapeutic range (obtained from pharmacy records).


**6. Diagnosis and Treatment**

* **6.1 Main Diagnosis:**  Information not provided.  (To be added after further investigation and lumbar puncture results).
* **6.2 Differential Diagnoses:** Seizure (potentially complicated by meningitis or encephalitis), other causes of altered mental status. A focal lesion is considered less likely given the absence of focal neurological deficits other than confusion, but the possibility is not entirely ruled out.
* **6.3 Treatment Plan:** Lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis or encephalitis. Initiation of broad-spectrum antibiotic and antiviral therapy pending lumbar puncture results. Empiric treatment for bacterial meningitis (pending LP results): Ceftriaxone 2 grams IV every 12 hours, plus Vancomycin 15mg/kg IV every 8-12 hours (target trough level 15-20 mcg/mL), and Acyclovir 10mg/kg IV every 8 hours. Close monitoring for ongoing seizure activity or respiratory compromise. No adjustment to current levetiracetam is recommended at this time.
