**Medical Report**

**1. Patient Information:** A 16-year-old female patient presented to the emergency department.  Weight was not recorded.

**2. Medical History:** The patient has a history of well-controlled epilepsy, managed with levetiracetam 500mg twice daily.  Her maternal family history includes migraines.

**3. Clinical Presentation:** The patient experienced an approximately 30-second episode of apnea, characterized by unresponsiveness. Post-apnea, she exhibited confusion, tiredness, and a mild headache.  Her mother reported a low-grade fever of 38.2°C (100.8°F) at home.  During the apneic episode, the patient appeared stiff.

**4. Physical Examination:** On examination, the patient appeared tired but was alert and oriented to person and place (though disoriented to date). Cranial nerves II-XII were intact.  Motor strength was 5/5 bilaterally in all extremities, with normal tone and 2+ symmetric reflexes.  Lung sounds were clear bilaterally, and meningeal signs were absent.

**5. Additional Examinations:** Vital signs were: temperature 38.2°C, heart rate 90 bpm, respiratory rate 18 breaths/min, blood pressure 110/70 mmHg, and SpO2 98% on room air. Point-of-care glucose was 90 mg/dL.  Levetiracetam levels were within the therapeutic range (confirmed via pharmacy records).

**6. Diagnosis and Treatment:**  A definitive diagnosis is pending further investigation, specifically the results of a lumbar puncture. Differential diagnoses include seizure (potentially complicated by meningitis or encephalitis), and other causes of altered mental status.  A focal lesion is considered less likely given the absence of focal neurological deficits beyond confusion, but remains a possibility.  Treatment includes a lumbar puncture to rule out meningitis or encephalitis. Empiric treatment for bacterial meningitis (pending lumbar puncture results) has been initiated with Ceftriaxone 2 grams IV every 12 hours, Vancomycin 15mg/kg IV every 8-12 hours (target trough level 15-20 mcg/mL), and Acyclovir 10mg/kg IV every 8 hours.  The patient is under close monitoring for ongoing seizure activity or respiratory compromise.  No adjustment to the current levetiracetam regimen is indicated at this time.  **Highlight:** The pending lumbar puncture results are crucial for definitive diagnosis and adjustment of treatment.  The empiric antibiotic and antiviral therapy is based on the differential diagnoses of meningitis and encephalitis.
